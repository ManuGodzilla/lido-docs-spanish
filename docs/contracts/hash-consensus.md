## What is HashConsensus

HashConsensus is a contract responsible for managing oracle members committee and allowing the members to reach consensus on a data hash for each reporting frame.

Time is divided in frames of equal length, each having reference slot and processing deadline. Report data must be gathered by looking at the world state (both Ethereum Consensus and Execution Layers) at the moment of the frame’s reference slot (including any state changes made in that slot), and must be processed before the frame’s processing deadline.

Frame length is defined in Ethereum Consensus Layer epochs. Reference slot for each frame is set to the last slot of the epoch preceding the frame’s first epoch. The processing deadline is set to the last slot of the last epoch of the frame.

Note that all state changes a report processing could entail are guaranteed to be observed while gathering data for the next frame’s report. This is an essential property given that oracle reports sometimes have to contain diffs instead of the entire state, which might be impractical or even impossible to transmit and process.

Consensus members rotate within one time into two subsets:

- Non-fast-lane members
- [Fast-lane members](/contracts/hash-consensus#fast-lane-members)

Once the consensus is gathered, a [Report processor](#report-processor-ireportasyncprocessor) would allow submitting and processing the actual report data.
The latter is a part of the [phased Oracle report flow](/docs/guías/oracle-operator-manual.md#oracle-phases).

## Report processor (`IReportAsyncProcessor`)

`IReportAsyncProcessor` defines the interface for a contract that gets consensus reports (i.e. hashes) pushed to and processes them asynchronously.
`HashConsensus` doesn't expect any specific behavior from a report processor, and guarantees the following:

1. `HashConsensus` won't submit reports via `IReportAsyncProcessor.submitConsensusReport` or ask to discard
reports via `IReportAsyncProcessor.discardConsensusReport` for any slot up to (and including)
the slot returned from `IReportAsyncProcessor.getLastProcessingRefSlot`.

2. `HashConsensus` won't accept member reports (and thus won't include such reports in calculating the consensus)
that have `consensusVersion` argument of the `HashConsensus.submitReport` call holding a diff.
value than the one returned from `IReportAsyncProcessor.getConsensusVersion`
at the moment of the `HashConsensus.submitReport` call.

There are two core protocol contracts that implements this interface:

- [AccountingOracle](./accounting-oracle)
- [ValidatorsExitBusOracle](./validators-exit-bus-oracle.md)

## Fast-lane members

Fast lane members is a subset of all members that changes each reporting frame. These members can, and are expected to, submit a report during the first part of the frame called the "fast lane interval" and defined via [setFrameConfig](#setframeconfig) or [setFastLaneLengthSlots](#setfastlanelengthslots). The calculation of the Fast-lane members subset depends on `frameIndex`, `totalMembers` and `quorum`. Under regular circumstances, all other members are only allowed to submit a report after the fast lane interval passes. This is done to encourage each oracle from the full set to participate in reporting on a regular basis, and identify any malfunctioning members.

The fast lane subset consists of quorum members; selection is implemented as a sliding window of the quorum width over member indices (`mod` total members). The window advances by one index each reporting frame.

With the fast lane mechanism active, it's sufficient for the monitoring to check that consensus is consistently reached during the fast lane part of each frame to conclude that all members are active and share the same consensus rules.

:::note
There is no guarantee that, at any given time, it holds true that only the current fast lane members can or were able to report during the currently-configured fast lane interval of the current frame.

In particular, this assumption can be violated in any frame during which the members set, initial epoch, or the quorum number was changed, or the fast lane interval length was increased.

Therefore, the fast lane mechanism should not be used for any purpose other than monitoring of the members liveness, and monitoring tools should take into consideration the potential irregularities within frames with any configuration changes.
