# WithdrawalVault

- [Source Code](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/blob/master/contracts/0.8.9/WithdrawalVault.sol)
- [Deployed Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb9d7934878b5fb9610b3fe8a5e441e8fad7e293f)

## What is WithdrawalVault

A simple contract that accumulates partial and full withdrawals that comes from
the Beacon Chain. Its address corresponds to the type-0x01 Lido withdrawal credentials.
During the accounting oracle report, the vault is emptied by Lido to the internal buffer; see [Lido contract docs](lido.md#informe-de-or√°culo) for details.

The vault is recoverable, so any ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens can be transferred to the treasury by DAO.

The currently deployed version is upgradable because of anticipated Ethereum withdrawal mechanics changes.

:::note
The contract is meant to be ossified somewhere after withdrawal credentials triggerable exits are implemented.
